# ðŸ“° Agentic News Scraper

This project is an **Agentic Workflow** that autonomously generates a personalized news digest on a random trending topic. It simulates how AI agents can collaborate to plan, search, summarize, and compile information â€” all without human input after execution.

## ðŸš€ What It Does

The system consists of four agents that work together:

1. **PlannerAgent** â€“ Randomly chooses a topic (e.g., sports, politics, or current events).
2. **SearcherAgent** â€“ Uses Google News search and BeautifulSoup to retrieve relevant article URLs.
3. **SummarizerAgent** â€“ Downloads and summarizes each article using a Hugging Face model (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`).
4. **CompilerAgent** â€“ Formats the summarized content into a clean, Markdown-based newsletter.

At the end, the digest is displayed directly in the notebook using Google Colabâ€™s `Markdown` renderer.
